# Crighter

Crighter is a Security/Emergency/SoS mobile application designed to enhance personal safety by providing users with real-time geolocation, emergency alerts, and incident reporting. This app is particularly useful for individuals in potentially unsafe situations, allowing them to quickly and discreetly send alerts to their emergency contacts.

## Features

- **Emergency SOS Alerts**: Instantly send an SOS alert to your pre-defined contacts with a simple button press.
- **Real-Time Location Sharing**: Share your location with emergency contacts during an SOS alert, even in areas with poor connectivity.
- **Offline Functionality**: Send emergency SMS alerts even when there's no internet connection.
- **Incident Reporting**: Capture and share critical information such as photos, audio, and location coordinates during emergencies.
- **AI-Based Incident Detection**: Automatically detect and report incidents based on sensor data.
- **Secure Data Storage**: All captured data is encrypted and securely stored for future reference.
