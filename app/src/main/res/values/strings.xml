\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>BLEEDING</b>\n\n\n
Before providing care, put on protective gloves or use a barrier between you and the victim, to reduce the chance of disease transmission while assisting the injured person. Cleanse your hands thoroughly with soap and water when finished.\n
Basic first aid treatment:\n
â€¢	CALL Hospital for medical assistance.\n
â€¢	Keep victim lying down.\n
â€¢	Apply direct pressure using a clean cloth or sterile dressing directly on the wound.\n
â€¢	DO NOT take out any object that is lodged in a wound; see a doctor for help in removal.\n
â€¢	If there are no signs of a fracture in the injured area, carefully elevate the wound above the victim\'s heart.\n
â€¢	Once bleeding is controlled, keep victim warm by covering with a blanket, continuing to monitor for shock.\n
        \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<b>CLEANING &amp; BANDAGING WOUNDS</b>\n\n\n
â€¢	Wash your hands and cleanse the injured area with clean soap and water, then blot dry.\n
â€¢	Apply antibiotic ointment to minor wound and cover with a sterile gauze dressing or bandage that is slightly larger than the actual wound.\n
        \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\<b>EYE INJURIES</b>\n\n\n
â€¢	If an object is impaled in the eye, CALL Hospital and DO NOT remove the object.\n
â€¢	Cover both eyes with sterile dressings or eye cups to immobilize.\n
â€¢	Covering both eyes will minimize the movement of the injured eye.\n
â€¢	DO NOT rub or apply pressure, ice, or raw meat to the injured eye.\n
â€¢	If the injury is a black eye, you may apply ice to cheek and area around eye, but not directly on the eyeball itself.\n
How to flush the eyes: If chemical is in only one eye, flush by positioning the victim\'s head with the contaminated eye down. . . to prevent flushing the chemical from one eye to another. Flush with cool or room temperature water for 15 minutes or more. Remove contact lenses after flushing.\n
        \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\<b>BURNS</b>\n\n\n
First Degree Burn: Skin will appear red and may be swollen or painful. Generally does not require medical attention.\n
Second Degree Burn: Skin will appear red, blistered and swollen. May require medical attention.\n
Third Degree Burn: Skin will be visibly charred and may be white. Usually very painful. REQUIRES MEDICAL ATTENTION.\n
Basic first aid treatment for 1st degree &amp; some 2nd degree burns:\n
Submerge burn area immediately in cool water until pain stops. If affected area is large, cover with cool wet cloths. Do not break blisters if they are present. If pain persists but no medical assistance is needed, apply medicated first aid cream or gel and cover with sterile dressing. If medical attention is needed, do not apply any cream. Just cover with a dry, sterile dressing and seek medical help immediately. basic first aid treatment for 3rd degree &amp; some 2nd degree burns: CALL Hospital !! Third degree burns MUST RECEIVE MEDICAL ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY! DO NOT try to remove any clothing stuck to the burned area. Cover with sterile dressing or clean sheet. DO NOT apply any creams or gels.\n\n\n

â€¢	Flush the affected area with cool running water for at least 15 minutes.\n
â€¢	Remove all clothing and jewelry that has been contaminated.\n
â€¢	Monitor victim for shock and seek medical assistance.\n
â€¢	If chemical burn is in the eyes, flush continuously with water and seek medical attention immediately.\n
SUNBURN\n
â€¢	Avoid any further exposure to direct sunlight.\n
â€¢	Drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration.\n
â€¢	Do not apply cold water or ice to a severe burn.\n

â€¢	If the victim cannot speak, breathe, or cough, ask for someone to call Hospital and then perform the Heimlich maneuver (abdominal thrust).\n
â€¢	How to perform the Heimlich maneuver: Position yourself behind the victim with your arms around victimâ€™s stomach. Place the thumb-side of your fist above the victimâ€™s navel and below the lower end of the breastbone. Take hold of your fist with your free hand and pull fist upward and in, quickly and firmly. Continue with thrusts until the object is dislodged or airway is clear.\n
INFANT CHOKING\n
â€¢	Place infant face down on your forearm supporting the head and neck with your hand. Rest your hand on your knee with the infantâ€™s head lower than itâ€™s body.\n

â€¢	If poison is in the eye, flush with lukewarm water for 15 minutes. Adults can stand under the shower with eyes open. always consult medical professionals after any eye injury has occurred.\n

â€¢	Clean wound and apply cold compress to reduce swelling.\n
â€¢	Remove tight clothing and jewelry from areas near the bite in case swelling occurs.\n
â€¢	Watch for signs of shock or allergic reaction. Signs include swelling or itching at the wound site, dizziness, nausea or difficulty breathing. Seek medical attention immediately if any of these signs occur.\n
â€¢	Continue monitoring victim for shock until medical help arrives.\n
